# `python py2048.py`

2048 in python for terminals


So far, only tested on a MacBook Pro running OSX 10.8.5, via iTerm2 and using python 2.7.6.
Having reached freedom after finals week, I decided to play around.

Inspired by http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ and https://github.com/bfontaine/term2048

Work in progress...
